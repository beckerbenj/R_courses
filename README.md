## Take Aways from FDZ Autumn 2022
more time for git, maybe split it between two days
(installation/setup alone 45 minutes!)

RMarkdown was a lot faster than anticipated (but participants were already familiar)
RMarkdown & Scripts maybe more concrete exercises

Quarto next time?

papaja? seems to be a mess still

## Take Aways from FDZ 2022
Topics and time management were excellent!  
audience was very fitting as a target group  

check functional exercises, in parts unnecessarily complicated (-> having a simpler split apply combine exercise) lapply exercise idea: different participant files that need to be processed and summarized

Try out breakout sessions in exercises?  topics to discuss? Important: have early interactions so people get lose  
Maybe add tips to exercises (unique(), paste(),...)
