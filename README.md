## Take Aways from FDZ 2022
Topics and time management were excellent!  
audience was very fitting as a target group  

check functional exercises, in parts unnecessarily complicated (-> having a simpler split apply combine exercise) lapply exercise idea: different participant files that need to be processed and summarized

Try out breakout sessions in exercises?  topics to discuss? Important: have early interactions so people get lose  
Maybe add tips to exercises (unique(), paste(),...)
