## Title

Advanced Programming in R


## Abstract

In various scientific fields, R has become as a popular tool for data processing, analysis and visualization. Yet in addition to a software package for statistical modeling and data analysis, R is also a fully functioning programming language. Moreover, one of the main design principles of R is to "turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully" (John Chambers). However, for many R users with a limited programming background, a large proportion of Râ€™s potential remains untapped. 

This workshop explores the possibilities and benefits of (also) using R as a programming language, and aims to provide experienced R users with more advanced programming skills. The workshop focuses on both tools that automate R-tasks, writing efficient code and helpful functions, as well as on obtaining a better understanding of how R works. 

After the course, participants should be able to read, understand, and adapt code from others, write their own functions, and should be able to use the R more efficiently.


## Workshop Content

After setting up an RStudio environment that supports writing efficient and elegant R-code, the following topics will be explained and illustrated using examples and exercises:

- Good programming practices
- iteration, and the Split-Apply-Combine paradigm
- Writing efficient functions
- Debugging
- scoping
- (and more)


## Required Knowledge and Experience 

Experience with R is required. 

* Participants should be able to:
	- efficiently read and write data in R
	- manipulate data with base R functions
	- fit statistical models
	- make visualizations of data
	
* Participants should have basic knowledge about:
	-  data types in R (e.g., know the difference between a data.frame, an array, a list),
	-  programming in R (e.g., use "if" and "if else"). 


## Language:

The workshop and workshop materials are in English.



## Software Requirements.

R [>= 4.2.2], 
RStudio [>= 2022.12.0]
