In an era shaped by large language models (LLMs), is it still worth learning R? This workshop explores how LLMs can support both R-learners and expert coders. The workshop will highlight strengths, limitations, and best use cases of using LLMs for R-coding. Participants will learn about strategies that help develop a strong learning mindset, about practical R resources for all skill levels, and about recommendations for effective and maintainable R coding practices.
