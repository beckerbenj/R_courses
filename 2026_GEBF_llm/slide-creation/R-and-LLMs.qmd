# R and RStudio

## What is R?

* statistical software package

  - statistical modeling and inference
  - read and write data
  - select, filter, and transform data
  - visualize data and models
  
  
* programming language

  - code for data-analysis, data manipulation, visualization, ...
  - code for text processing, file creation, ....
  

  
## R as a Programming Language?

* a programming language 
* clear and logical syntax[^1]
* lot's of R-code available online 
   - CRAN: packages with vignettes and examples, 
   - github, and other repositories, 
   - stack overflow, etc.

$\Rightarrow$ Ideal for LLMs for generating R-code!

[^1]: R is not always consistent nor logical



## What is RStudio?

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that focuses on R

It combines: 

  - graphical interface
  - file browser
  - environment overview
  - syntax highlighting
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - ...

And allows integration of:

  - Rmarkdown and quarto
  - git and github
  - large language models
  - ...



## What is RStudio?

R studio can also supports other programming languages (like python).

And there are also other IDE's that are excellent for working with R, and 
also allow an integretion of large language models:

* VSCode
* Positron
* ...



# Large Language Models

- OpenAI: GPT-4.1 (also Microsoft/github Copilot)

- Anthorpic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet 

- Alphabet/Google: Google Gemini 2.5 

- Meta: LLaMa 3.1/3.2 $\rigtharrow$ open source

- DeepSeek-V3/R1 

- Mistral: Large 2.1 ()

- ...


## Interactive chat use vs API use

Interactive chat: 

* a chatbot (like chatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Claude, ...)
* via a website (with log in)
* with a memory (of the current conversation = *stateful*)
* with a memory of previous conversations
* $\Rightarrow$ with server space for conversations, files, ...
* payment via monthly subscriptions (and free versions)

API use: 

* uses an Application Programming Interface (API) to directly access the LMM
* API differs between providers
* payment per million tokens (some free versions) [pricing](https://pricepertoken.com/leaderboards/coding) 
* without built-in memory (*stateless*)


## LLM via chatbots

* [Claude](https://claude.ai/login)
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
* [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)


## Comparing the results

Disdvantages: 

* R code cannot be run/checked by the chatbots (but python code can.)




## LLM via API

* Through [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) and RStudio (google gemini account required)
* via the positron integration of github-copilot (github account required)


### `ellmer`

`ellmer` is an R-package (developed by the Posit team). It allows you to use LLMs 
directly for R (and RStudio) via the API option.

Some features:
* supports different LLMs (accounts and API-key are required)
* supports local LLMs
* keeps track of the conversation (makes it *stateful*)
* multiple conversations at the same time.


### `ellmer` illustration 


### Other R-packages

The `kick()` function of the `side` package creates a *sidekick* that sees the objects in your working environment and can use tools to read and write files, read R documentation, ...

An attempt to build Claude Code or Copilot in R, but [experimental](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/2025-11-11-sidekick/).






























# Best practices?


## For Learning the R-language

Ask to explain code with prompts like: 


> You are an expert R coder and experienced data analyst and excellent at explaining code. 
> Explain the following code chunk step by step. Explain what and why.
> 
> <R code>


## For Learning the R-language

Ask feedback and improvements on your code 

> You are an expert R coder and experienced data analyst and excellent at explaining code. 
> Improve the following code chunk and explain your improvements step by step. 
> 
> <R code>


## For writing R-code

Ask for examples



## For data-analysis










## But

Look at the available documentation

- Many R-packages have great documentation (including vignettes)

And maybe ask Google first.

- There have likely been persons with similar questions/problems (check stack overflow, reddit, ...)
- There are many great tutorials that can be found by web searching

## Not covered in this workshop

* MCPs (connect tools to an LLM)
