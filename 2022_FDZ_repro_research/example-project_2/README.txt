This is another example project.

This example project could be any data-related project. For instance, a project where you apply some data-analytic method to some data. Maybe resulting in a research manuscript. 

The README file could give some information of what the project is about, and what can be found in the project subfolders. The information should be clear and to the point. Readers should understand what the project is about, without unnecessary detail.
